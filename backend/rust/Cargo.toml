# Create dynamic library, but NOT compiled for windows (.dll), linux (.dylib) or macOS (.so or .dylib)
# So we build a C dynamic library, not a rust dynamic library (dylib) that is loaded by the browser.

# wasm-opt has reduced total worker bundle size from ~2.1MB to ~1.6MB
# With optimisation: Total Upload: 1675.83 KiB / gzip: 582.77 KiB
# Unfortunately it also slows the build down from a few seconds to a minute.
